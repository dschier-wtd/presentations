## 📊 Kinds

- Metric Collection
- Availability
- Telemetry
- Tracing
- Surveys
- Log Collection
- Scanning

---

## 📊 Types

- Health
- Performance
- Usage
- Behavior
- NPS
- Security
- and many more

---

## 💰 Reasoning

Well, what shall we monitor?

- CPU?
- Disk?
- Daily active users?
- Most visited page?
- Uptime of machines?
- Pending patches?

---

## 💰 Reasoning

- Monitoring MUST provide NEW insights
- Monitoring MUST cause changes
- Monitoring MUST have a business impact

**Please don't monitor for the sake of monitoring.**
