## :wave: Hi

- :man: Daniel Schier
- Some might say, I am a "DevOps engineer", ...
- ... but I see myself as an IT craftsman.
- I am also contributing to Open Source, democratizing software.
- I do some blogging, conferences and organize meetups.
- I love to make nice memories, have a good conversation and learn new stuff.
