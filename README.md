# Presentations

Material for presentations and talks I have given.

## Motivation

I just wanted to publish my presentation content that I worked on
for conferences, meetups and more. Maybe it is helpful for someone
else, too.

## Description

The repository contains all kinds of unsorted material like
presentations, code examples, snippets and more. Furthermore,
I have added a couple of links to other repositories, where
you can find presentations from me.

### Content

- [Ansible Anwendertreffen 2021](./20210518-ansible-anwendertreffen/)
- [Ansible Anwendertreffen 2022](./20220215-ansible-anwendertreffen/)

### Links

- TBD

## Contribute

The repository contains content of things that happened in the past.
Therefore, I am not investing much time to keep code examples up-to-date
or fiddle with minor issues. Nevertheles, if you find something, that is
either downright wrong or content is not usable from your side, please
feel free to open an issue or provide a pull request.
