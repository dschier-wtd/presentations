A product requirements document describes the expectations, vision and goals
of a certain project. It can also be used as a Change Request Document (CRD) and
explain why a certain change should be made and how it will be executed.

For this document, we will have a look at the project "a new bee hive".

## Vision/Purpose (Why to work)

A new queen is born and we are aiming to establish a new colony with the new
queen. We are eager to grow the population, create more honey and collect more
pollen.

We are aiming to provide a reliable, robust and scalable hive, that is close
to the meadows and out of range from the bears.

## Strategy/Objectives (What to work on)

As the task force for the new hive, we are aiming towards the below objectives
and results:

- robust and reliable hive
  - design and provide blueprints
  - gather and compare information from other hives
  - interview the most competent worker bees
  - hive must be rain-safe
  - hive must have emergency exits
  - building the hive

- providing resources and knowledge
  - organize and provide building resources
  - provide needed tools
  - provide honey for all workers
  - teach and train junior bees
  - note down best practices

- proximity to honey and pollen sources
  - location evaluation
  - evaluate with neighbors
  - evaluate possible growth

- secure and safe location
  - gather information about attack vectors
  - testing against bear attacks
  - testing build quality
  - regular quality inspections

## Mission/Commitments (How to work)

As the task force for the new hive, we commit to:

- design a good and comfortable hive
- document our work
- keep the quality high
- use standardized hive construction patterns
- communicate our work regularly
- keep the bears and honey badgers out

## Risks

Moving to a new hive introduces risks, but there are also risks, if we don't
move to a new location. I want to explain some of the major risks here and how
we want to mitigate them.

### Risks when doing

1. The new hive is not stable enough
   Our worker bees are very skilled and repair upcoming damages in time.
   Furthermore, we want to do quality tests with a minimal viable hive, so we
   can see if our work fits the demand.
2. Bears might attack
   We will locate the hive in a high position, which is hard to reach. In
   addition, we want to do honeypot tests beforehand.
3. Not enough pollen and honey
   We will choose a location, close to the meadows. We will also take care, that
   no other bee hives are in proximity of 2 km.

### Risks when not doing

1. Single point of failure
   If we don't migrate, every accident to the hive can potentially lead to the
   extinction of our civilization.
2. Civil war
   Since we are having two queens, there is possibility for a revolution and or
   civil war.

## Market

Knowing the customers of a project is key to get a good understanding. As a
bee, we need to know whom we are working with and which demand they have.

### The queen

As the queen, I want to have a safe and secure location in the middle of a hive.
It must be protected against heat, cold and bears. I also want to give birth to
new bees, which requires access to pollen and honey. Workers must reach me
easily and drones must be able to protect me.

### The worker bee

As a worker bee, I want to produce as much honey as possible and build the hive.
Therefore, I need access to pollen. I also take care of repair work and food
service. Therefore I need free access to all parts of the hive. Sometimes, I am
followed by enemies, which want to steal the honey. Having some hiding options
is vital.

### The drone

As the drone, I am responsible for the defense of the hive. I need multiple
options to protect the hive fast and from different directions. The location of
the hive must be considered, so it is easier to protect.

I also need to have food located near the entrances, so I can restore stamina
during protection scenarios.
